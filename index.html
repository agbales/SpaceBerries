            <h2>Data Viz Jam Sessions</h2>
            <b>Q: What is this?</b> <br>
            A: Data Viz Jam Sessions, or as we call it for short, DVJS, is a community of data visualization experts and
            enthusiasts centered around Meetup events where we show off our work, ask questions, and connect with other
            folks in the field. We're language-agnostic, multidisciplinary, and open to all experience levels. We are
            born of one primary axiom: if what you want doesn't exist, make it.
            <br><br>
            <b>Q: Where are you located?</b> <br>
            A: Our first chapter started in 2016 in Seattle, Washington. We opened our second group a year later in the
            beautiful Montreal, Canada. <br><br>
            <b>Q: What on Earth is that logo?</b> <br>
            A: Jam is made out of smushed berries and everthing is cooler in space. Make sense? <br><br>
            <b>Q: How can I get involved?</b> <br>
            A: Check out our Seattle and Montreal chapters or connect with other creators through our Facebook group.
            Enjoy!

            <h4>But please remember…</h4>
            <b>Monitor the volume.</b> This can be a noisy space but if we all speak softly theb we can all feel heard.
            <br>
            <b>Respect different working styles. </b>Some folks prefer to focus and that’s totally fine! If you’re
            feeling chatty there will always be someone else to share with.
            <br>
            <b>Be considerate.</b> This is a volunteer-run, free event. We love ideas but pointed complaints and
            criticism are less helpful. Let the facilitator know if you are interested in becoming a dedicated resource
            for the group.
            <br>
            <b>Data vis is for everyone.</b> This group is fortunate to have people from many backgrounds with a range
            of experiences. Leave the competition at the door and come ready to challenge your own skills and
            perspectives.
